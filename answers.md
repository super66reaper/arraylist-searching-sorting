//Searching

1.The binary search can more easily find it with logic instead of the search
2.The binary one is more efficent because it divides the deck in half each time to try to get closer each time to the correct answer. A algorithm is efficent when it finds what its looking for without using to much processing and doesn't have the need to run through all items.
3.
    I.The search would first go apple than banana than cherry and so on
    The binary search would start with Lime and than would split the deck in half if the blueberry is in there 
    II.Binary would go through 3 and search would go through all of the items, 11
    III.The numbers would be much greater but the search number would be exponentially bigger compared to the binary search
