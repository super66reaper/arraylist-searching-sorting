//Searching

1.What I used was a normal deck of cards. I realized that the binary is lots faster and doesn't come into issues as much as the other one with duplicates, ect.
2.The binary one is more efficent because it divides the deck in half each time to try to get closer each time to the correct answer. A algorithm is efficent when it finds what its looking for without using to much processing and doesn't have the need to run through all items.
3.
    I.The search would first go apple than banana than cherry and so on
    The binary search would start with Lime and than would split the deck in half if the blueberry is in there 
    II.Binary would go through 2 and search went through all of the items
    III.The numbers would be much greater but the search number would be much bigger compared to the binary search because binary only splits the deck in half and keeps splitting in half compared to search which would always be going through the whole deck

//Sorting

1.Bubble Sorting is not repetative and easy to do compared to the others
    The selective sorting is the one that takes the longest and bubble and insertion was the simplist as your only dealing with 2 at a time for the bubble and insertion is only dealing with what needs to be dealt with
2.
    I.It would do 90 for the selective sorting and insertion and bubble are both equal for about the length minus 1 so 9
    II.bubble and selective would be 90 but insertion would be half of that
    III.Bubble would be 9 and than 99 and so on but insertion would be less but the exact number is hard to calculate
3.It would be reasonable to sort and use binary search as it is much more efficent than the normal search even with sorting it before.
